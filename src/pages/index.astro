      <h2>What I Think About</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        After two decades in infrastructure work, I've developed opinions on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When to scale and when to wait, and how to tell the difference</li>
        <li>Cloud cost optimization from architecture to line-item</li>
        <li>Platform engineering for teams under 50 people</li>
        <li>Kubernetes: when it helps and when it's expensive overkill</li>
        <li>Building SRE practices that fit the company you actually have</li>
        <li>Migration planning that survives contact with reality</li>
      </ul>
